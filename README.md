It downloads, cuts and names the PictoSprites from old Just Dance Now servers  

In order to use it just double click the .py (or .exe if you dont have python and wants to use it with no problems) and follow the instructions

Remember that you can get the CodeName of each song in the Just Dance wikia https://justdance.fandom.com

This tool its manly for modding, but if you dont want the pictos streched to 256x256 change the variable "stretch" to "False" with a Text Editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text
